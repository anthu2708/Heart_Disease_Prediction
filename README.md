# Heart Disease Prediction using K-NN

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether patients have heart disease based on their maximum heart rate during strenuous exercise and ST depression induced by exercise. We utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) model for this predictive analysis.


## Project Description

Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide, and early prediction can be crucial for timely intervention. In this project, we explore the relationship between exercise parameters (maximum heart rate and ST depression) and the likelihood of heart disease using the K-NN algorithm. 

The goal is to provide insights and a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes various features related to patients' health and exercise results. Key features include:

- **Maximum Heart Rate (max_hr)**: The highest heart rate achieved during exercise.
- **ST Depression (st_depression)**: The depression induced by exercise testing, indicating heart condition.

The dataset is provided in the repository and is used to train and evaluate the K-NN model.
